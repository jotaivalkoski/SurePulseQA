# SurePulseQA
Quality assurance plan for SurePulse.
## Vision
This is designed to be a manual test plan for QA on SurePulse. It is expected to take an hour or so to complete. 
Following each step of the SurePulse QA plan will assure quality releases. The QA plan will contain a `README.md` in each folder with further instructions.

1. Pull this repo to get the latest QA files
2. Run QA on __a built and installed version of SurePulse__. NOT from SurePulse run from an IDE. 
3. Create a new workspace to build everything in from scratch.

Proceed through the folders in this order
- BarSetup
- CompressionTest
- TensionRectangularTest
